###Problem Statement:
_A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve._
Many students, particularly first generation and low income students, take out student loans to go to college with little understanding of how it will impact their future, what an average debt load is, and what a reasonable repayment plan will look like based on future earnings. Data published in the federal College Scorecard <https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/> in September 2015 have new insights for the decision-making process, but many students may not dig through the layers of the federal website so I wanted to make discussions of cost, debt, and earnings front and center.

###Market Research:
_Outline the key insights from your research, including:
your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions), research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem. Differentiation: what makes your idea/product different_
- The main competitor is the College Scorecard website <https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/>
  - Other sites are also using this dataset for analysis
    - <http://scholarmatcher.scholarmatch.org/>
    - <http://www.startclass.com/>
    - <https://collegeabacus.org/>
- Major news outlets have done their own analyses of the dataset, e.g.
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/upshot/gaps-in-alumni-earnings-stand-out-in-release-of-college-data.html>
<http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/09/18/440973097/obama-wont-rate-colleges-so-we-did>

  - My product is differentiated by:
    - Breaking down data by family income (available in the raw dataset, but fairly obsfuscated within the website)
    - Providing if/then scenarios (hopefully side-by-side comparison)
    - User interactivity
    - Clear, concise _this is why this matters_
###User Personas:
_A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?_
- Target audience is high school juniors and seniors and their families
  - Digital natives - interface must be clean and useable
  - Young audience - cannot overload with facts and data
  - Low-income/first-generation focus, so data must be very clear and concise
  - Parents may be English language learners, so language used must be clear and concise
  - Additional phases could have an implementation for high school guidance counselors or a parent-specific version
- This information is freely available, so my value-adds are:
  - Stripping away unnecessary complexities
  - Providing a clean interface (not spreadsheet dropdowns)
  - Presentation and analysis in clear and easy to comprehend ways
