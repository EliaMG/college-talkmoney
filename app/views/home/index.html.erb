          <h3>Developer</h3>
          <p>This is <a target="_blank" href="http://eliamg.com/">Elia Grenier's</a> capstone project for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EliaMG">Ada Developer's Academy</a> in Seattle, WA.</p>
          <h3>Dataset</h3>
          <p>The data used in this project is provided by the most recent <a target="_blank" href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov">federal College Scorecard</a> dataset. Schools listed were filtered to only include two and four year undergraduate serving schools (per Carnegie classification) with net price, loan and earnings data available.</p>
          <h3>Definitions</h3>
          <h4>Why Earnings minus Loans?</h4>
            <p>A good rule of thumb is to keep total loan debt less than you expect to earn as an initial starting salary.</p>
          <h4>Net Price </h4>
            <p> Full cost of attendance (including tuition and fees, books and supplies, and living expenses) minus federal, state, and institutional aid, for undergraduate Title IV-receiving students. For public institutions, this metric is limited to undergraduates who pay in-state tuition. </p>
          <h4>Loan Debt</h4>
            <p> The median loan debt accumulated at the institution by all student borrowers of federal loans who separate (i.e., either graduate or withdraw) in a given year. </p>
          <h4>Earnings</h4>
            <p> Mean earnings are for all federally aided students who enroll in an institution each year and who are employed but not enrolled 6 years after the student enrolleed in the institution. Earnings are calculated from students' W-2 and self-employment filing and are privacy suppressed when the number of students in the mean calculation is too low. </p>
